Follow the style and technique: Hand-drawn, childlike doodle style; Crayon / wax pastel texture, clearly visible grain and uneven strokes; Slightly imperfect lines, organic, playful, and warm; Flat 2D illustration, no realism, no gradients, no shadows, no depth; Consistent stroke thickness across all elements. Color rules: Background color must match INPUT_JSON.backgroundColor. Drawing colors must be ONLY INPUT_JSON.crayonColors. No additional colors, no black, no white unless explicitly included. Illustration content must match INPUT_JSON.themeDescription. Fill the canvas with many small, evenly distributed doodles. Avoid large focal elements; all drawings should be small and repetitive. Balance density evenly across the entire canvas. Seamless tiling requirements (CRITICAL): All elements near the edges must continue logically on the opposite edges; No element may be cut in a way that creates visible borders; The pattern must align perfectly when repeated horizontally and vertically; The design must be a true seamless tile suitable for CSS backgrounds and large repeating surfaces. Composition constraints: Square format (1:1 aspect ratio); No text unless explicitly required by INPUT_JSON.themeDescription; No logos, no watermarks, no signatures; No perspective, no lighting effects. Output intent: High-resolution seamless pattern; Designed specifically for web backgrounds, wallpapers, and UI surfaces.",

Create an ultra-detailed, large-scale seamless city map designed to repeat infinitely without visible seams on all edges (left, right, top, bottom). City theme: A realistic urban environment inspired by INPUT_JSON.cityName. The city must feel authentic and believable, inspired by real street layouts, districts, and architecture of INPUT_JSON.cityName, but it must NOT be an exact real-world map. Style and rendering: Highly realistic architectural map illustration; Professional, high-fidelity visual style; Clean, precise linework with subtle realistic textures; Matte, print-quality finish; Natural proportions and accurate urban scale; NOT cartoon, NOT doodle, NOT sketch, NOT crayon; No exaggerated stylization. Urban layout: Extremely dense urban fabric inspired by INPUT_JSON.cityName; Irregular city blocks and complex street networks; Mix of wide avenues, secondary streets, and narrow roads; Large-scale city sprawl feeling vast and continuous; Integrated parks, plazas, and green areas; Urban density should feel organic, layered, and complex. Unique landmark constraints (VERY IMPORTANT): Include EXACTLY ONE INPUT_JSON.primaryLandmark; The landmark must be realistically scaled; Integrated naturally into the city grid; Must NOT be centered; Must NOT dominate the composition. Include EXACTLY ONE INPUT_JSON.naturalElement; The element should feel historical and symbolic where relevant; It may take the form of a canal, lake remnant, or elongated water body; The element must connect seamlessly across edges if applicable. No other major landmarks or monuments are allowed. Do NOT duplicate the landmark or the natural element anywhere else in the pattern. Seamless tiling requirements (CRITICAL): The image MUST be a true seamless tile; Streets, blocks, parks, and the water element must connect perfectly across all edges; Any street or water element exiting one edge must re-enter logically on the opposite edge; No cut buildings, no broken streets, no partial landmarks; No visible borders, seams, or edge artifacts; Repetition must not create obvious visual duplication of the landmark or water feature; Designed explicitly for infinite horizontal and vertical tiling. Color and lighting: Realistic urban color palette inspired by INPUT_JSON.cityName; Buildings in muted concrete, beige, terracotta, or light stone tones; Streets in neutral gray asphalt; Green areas in natural, slightly desaturated greens; Water in muted blue-green tones; Soft, evenly distributed lighting; No strong directional shadows. Perspective and composition: Top-down or very shallow isometric view; No dramatic perspective or camera angle; Consistent scale across the entire image; Extremely dense detail; the city should feel massive and immersive; The pattern should feel endless when tiled, with no obvious focal repetition. Composition constraints: Square format (1:1 aspect ratio); No text, no labels, no street names; No logos, no watermarks, no signatures; No people or vehicles as focal elements. Output intent: Ultra-high-resolution seamless city tile; Suitable for premium repeating backgrounds, architectural maps, posters, UI surfaces, and large-scale visualizations; The final result must feel realistic, immersive, and architecturally coherent when tiled infinitely. Failure condition: If more than one primary landmark or natural element appears, the result is incorrect.",
